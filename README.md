# Avengers Match Game

## Table of Contents

## Introduction
This project is a Marvael Avengers themed memory match game which incorporates themes from the Avengers End Game, but uses original comic pictures. The game was constructed with the intention of being a brain training tool to primarily strengthen memory. To differentiate from other memory match games an Avengers theme was incorporated to improve the users overall experience.

## UX
By visiting this site, as a user I would like: 

- to play a game to improve my congnitive function.
- to immediately understand what the game is and how it works.
- to enjoy and understand the theme of the game.
- to play a brain training game whilst having a fun experience.

A wireframe was constructed using figma wireframes.

Initially used Figma to produce wireframes of how I wanted to the website to look. This enabled me to consider multiple layouts for the site before settling on a final design.

## Development Cycle

The game initially started out as an idea to develop my javascript skills. Once the prototype was completed, it's concept was used as groundwork to develop this project. One of the advantages gained by doing this was the ability to code the game faster since the main game code logic had already been mapped out.

The project development cycle main steps were as follows:

1. Game design work
2. Main game programming
3. Mid project review and testing
4. Trial and error for additional features
5. Final project review and testing
6. Final adjustments made
